## Company Information

Ancient Cyber Labs is a technology company focused on the design, manufacturing
and distribution of novel consumer hardware products with 100% Helium use in
mind.

Founded in 2022, the company is owned by a collective of successful technology
entrepreneurs and investors, who each bring to the table their unique experience
and success (i.e. several exits) in previous and other current ventures across various
related sectors.

Between them, the partners possess over 100 years of experience in manufacturing,
software development, digital marketing entrepreneurship and venture capital. They
are known for their significant experience in the end-to-end processing of products
including Smart Home and Smart City devices (such as the Tier e-scooter and Vaha
digital screen mirror), Android tablets and Android-embedded Displays, and LED
screens.

They have sold over 100,000 units to date, created several thousand IoT-enabled,
real-time digital advertising billboards across Germany, and are currently in the
process of adding 20,000 further displays (following current Series A of $80m).

Each of the team has always held the endeavours and ethos of Helium in high
regard, so it was the natural choice when considering partners for expansion.

One of our first companies, HYGH continues to disrupt Germany’s digital out-ofhome advertising market, implementing a modern business approach that integrates
technical advances like IoT, cloud computing and programmatic scheduling
algorithms as they seek to improve their customers’ advertising capabilities.

This translates directly to the beliefs of the Helium community and performance of its
technology, which we believe capable of completely disrupting the way that
automation and IoT will be innovated and implemented in the years ahead.

## Product Information

The Ancient Cyber Labs miner is the first product we seek to launch. It will initially
function as an indoor hotspot, with a wider-reaching outdoor hotspot version planned
for future production.

Our miner is a full indoor hotspot for operation using the Helium network. It is built
using Raspberry Pi 4, powered by a Semtech® SX1302 baseband LoRa® chip, and
supports EU868 LoRaWAN frequency.

It features integrated Bluetooth, WiFi and Ethernet connectivity, plus a
4.3 inch touchscreen for effortless hotspot control and the visually engaging
monitoring of varied data streams including rewards and sync status.

We plan also to provide a variety of accessories for the Ancient Cyber Labs hotspot e.g.
antennas and cables, with more accessories planned for development and release in
the future.

We are already finalizing our case designs and are going to be using a metal casing
for our hotspot.

## Approximate price point

Given current market conditions regarding both the supply (chips, Raspberry Pi etc.)
and demand side, our team believes that the initial price point of our hotspot
will be $500, in line with other market participants.

## Previous shipments

We have already shipped over 100,000 devices in different sectors (Smart home, IoT, smart
city), mainly to North America, Europe (NL, UK, DE), Singapore, Japan and Korea

## Which countries do you plan to ship to and get regulatory certifications for?

We are currently obtaining the relevant certificates for shipping products throughout
the EU through a CE-mark, which we will obtain from our manufacturing vendor. The
product will comply with all regulations as set forth by the regulating authority and
Helium.

We have already discussed the future adaptation of our product for US consumers
and will be conducting this expansion along a yet-to-be-determined timeframe.

## Customer Support

The experience of customers has been the core focus of all ventures by our founding
team members, and we will implement similar operating procedures with Ancient
Cyber Labs.

We aim to echo the user-first approach cultivated by each team member in their past
ventures. It is with this focus in mind that we offer lifetime support to all customers, a
practice that will be continued for the Helium-powered ACL hotspot and all future
products.

We foster a close relationship with Zendesk and implement their API into our sales
pages, which enables us to efficiently and effectively solve any and all customer
issues.

Furthermore, we will implement internal KPIs for the response times of our customer
service reps, which will be strictly monitored. In the beginning, one of our existing
team members will handle this responsibility.

We plan to equip our miner with a limited 2-year warranty. We will
maintain a stock of spare parts and replacement units in case of hardware damage
or failure.

Beyond an official warranty, Ancient Cyber Labs will continue its informal pledge to
provide customers with lifelong support whenever possible.

## Hardware Security Element

Security is a key concern to our team and we have implemented many measures to
ensure we offer maximum possible protection to our valued users.

The Ancient Cyber Labs hotspot will feature an ECC608 security chip that comes equipped with
an encrypted swarm key. We are also developing encrypted/locked-down firmware
and encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.

Transparency drives all we do at Ancient Cyber Labs. Our team is keen to submit a
prototype of the developments mentioned for Helium’s inspection and audit, as well
as share the results of such an audit with the public.

## Hardware Information

We will use the SX1302 and SX1250 LoRa Chipsets in our hotspot. For its
CPU, we have opted for the Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module, which we believe
superior to available alternatives.

We source a majority of our components from a long-time, trusted manufacturing
partner in China, who retrieves everything we need via Waveshare. For the LoRa
Chipsets, we maintain direct contact with Semtech and have a confimed order for 42,000 SX1302 chipsets.

Through our Chinese partner, we can confidently source 30,000 radio modules in the
next few months – and many more thereafter.

Due to the current Raspeberry Pi shortage we are working hard on a solution to build the miner using an alternative compute module. We have our best team on the case and will hopefully come up with a strong and viable solution shortly. This means that we will be able to provide our miners at a quicker pace to the comunity, whilst preserving or achieving a higher processing power for ourt miner.

## Software (currently in development):

  1. Custom-built Router Firmware with secure automatic remote updates
  2. Custom-built API web server and web-based Dashboard app for maintenance
  and monitoring of single or multiple devices

  Will be installed:
  
    a) as part of device firmware (with a compact web server) for HTTP/HTTPS
    access via LAN
    b) as a separate installation on our company’s private server cluster (Kubernetes)
    for remote access by device owners
  
  3. Custom build of open-source Helium Mobile App
  4. Custom build of the Desktop App (for Raspberry OS), which will be used to
  control device IPS display, show relevant information regarding device status,
  network connectivity and statistics, and for fast device setup (e.g. control
  device’s LAN/WiFi connectivity settings)

## Manufacturing Information

The members of our team have been working with a wide range of radio wave
technologies e.g. WIFI, Lora, Bluetooth and Zigbee.

We have also been involved in successful gateway constructions for each of these
technologies, and have built over 50,000 gateway units to date. At Ancient Cyber
Labs, we combine all this experience and look to set new standards in our sector.

Thanks also to close partnership with our manufacturer, who possesses 30 years of
hardware manufacturing experience and has worked on globally regarded projects,
our team is confident that our project bears relatively minimal risk.

## Expected Production and Delivery Timeline

If we factor in the use of off-the-shelf PCBs and assume that we will receive all
components needed to complete our initial run of 1,000 devices, we estimate an
expected production and delivery timeline of six weeks.

We forecast an increase in production thereafter and will aim to hit our target of
10,000 or more units shipped within six months of production start.

## Proof of Identity

We agree to comply with your typical proof of identity procedure:

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives.
Details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital

Within the first six months of sales, we aim to hit a sales target of 10,000 pieces
minimum. With our assessment of market demand, consumer interest and tech
trends, we expect to exceed this target.

Our team has $2million in freely available capital and is not reliant upon pre-sale
performance – if we even decide to have one.

We are confident that our current free capital shall be sufficient to meet, if not exceed
our volume targets. However, we are more than prepared for unforeseen events with
reliable access to angel money (one founder is one of Germany’s most active angel
investors and regularly co-invests with other industry figures) and a range of
additional borrowing facilities.

## Risks & Challenges

The primary potential risk lies in supply chain conditions currently seen across the
chip market.

Thanks to our extensive contacts across China, we are confident that we will be able
to source components regardless of shortages.
